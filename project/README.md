## Computer Organisation and Architecture in Assembly Language (RISC-V, SHAKTI)- (Project)
### In this repository under projects section, We use Assembly language programming to demonstrate translation of standard programming language constructs, setting up hardware assisted structures to demonstrate segmentation, interrupt service, task context maintenance and paging.
**Description about SHAKTI** - SHAKTI is an open-source initiative by the Reconfigurable Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) group at IIT-Madras. The SHAKTI project is building a family of 6 processors, based on the RISC-V ISA. The project has currently developed a Embedded class (called E-Class) and Controller class (called C-Class) of processor based on the RISC-V ISA. RISC-V (pronounced “risk-five”) is a free and open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration
